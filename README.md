These are the official notes behind the labs at **[canyouhack.me](https://canyouhack.me)** - my hands-on offensive security training platform built for people who learn by doing. If you want an environment to actually use these notes in, check it out.

## ⚡ Killer Feature — Live Command Injection

Open `GlobalVariables.md` and fill in your target details:

```yaml
Target-IP: 10.10.10.X
Username: administrator
Password: Passw0rd!
Domain: corp.local
DC Name: DC01
Password Hash: aabbccdd11223344aabbccdd11223344
Local IP: 10.10.14.X
```

Every note with a command block instantly updates to your target. No more find-and-replacing IPs across 400 files mid-engagement.

## 🗂 Structure

Notes are organised by **scope**, not technique:

```

│   ├── 1. Ports/               # Per-port AD enumeration
│   ├── 2. Techniques/          # NTLM relay, Kerberos attacks, poisoning
│   ├── 3. Privilege Esc/       # BloodHound paths, manual enum
│   └── 4. Tools/               # Mimikatz, Netexec, Validate hashes
├── port enumeration/           # Per-port playbooks (30+ ports)
├── Priv Esc/

## 🔑 AD Group Abuse Coverage

Windows group privilege escalation — each with full tool links and step-by-step flows:

- **Account Operators** — add users to privileged groups
- **Backup Operators** — dump SAM/NTDS via SeBackupPrivilege
- **Server Operators** — service binary hijacking → SYSTEM
- **Print Operators** — SeLoadDriverPrivilege → EoPLoadDriver → SYSTEM
- **Group Policy Creator Owners** — SharpGPOAbuse → scheduled task → SYSTEM
- **DNS Admins** — malicious DLL via dnscmd → SYSTEM
- **LAPS Readers** — read local admin passwords from AD
- **Exchange Windows Permissions** — WriteDACL → DCSync
